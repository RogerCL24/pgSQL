1.1. `SET` set the attribute (column) value by Gouda (in **first_name** column) and Lada (in **last_name** column) of all the tuples with the `WHERE` condition, `UPDATE` deletes the tuple and creates another one, for that reason is the last one after the query.

![second](https://github.com/RogerCL24/pgSQL/assets/90930371/a4d9a8a7-e839-4325-bb1c-5bb50c158e85)

1.2. Now there is no `WHERE` condition, therefore all the tuples will suffer the update in the column named at the `SET` statement

## 2. DELETE TABLE'S DATA
